  title: Voiceflow Dialog Management API
  description: |
    # Overview

    The Dialog Management API is an HTTP API served by Voiceflow's dialog management server.
    It allows your Voiceflow project to be easily integrated into any interface: chatbot, voice assistant, IVR, web chat, and more - without the hassle of implementing the conversational flow using code.

    By sending a request of what a user wants to do, you can use your Voiceflow project to generate the response.

    # Quick Start

    For developers eager to get started without worrying about the details, here are a few quick steps to make your first call with the API:

    1. **Create a project**. You need to first build a conversational project on *[Voiceflow Creator](https://creator.voiceflow.com)*.
    2. **Create API Key**. An admin of your Voiceflow workspace can create and manage API Keys under *Workspace Settings / Developers*.
    3. **Make a test call**. Use the examples below to make an API call. Make subsequent calls to the same endpoint,
      changing the `payload` to reflect what the user might say. See how the response trace changes based on where in the project the user is.<br/>
      *Make sure to replace the `{apiKey}` with what you've gathered on step 2*.
    4. **Implement your application**. Get familiar with the API by reading the rest of this documentation, and power the next conversation with your Voiceflow project!

    The **state** API is the *easier implementation* compared to the **stateless** API. But they both achieve the same function.

      Voiceflow managed user state - **interact** is the only essential endpoint

      All endpoints take in a `{userID}` parameter to identify the caller and associate their state to the call.

      ### userID
      You will need to generate `{userID}` yourself - it should be something unique that easily references the person on the session - such as an username, email, device ID, or phone number.
      (*e.g.* `user54646`, `user@gmail.com`, `1-647-424-4242`, etc.).
      If you're not sure what to call it just for testing purposes, you can just pick a random `{userID}` like *steve*.

      For example _".../user/**steve**/interact"_ is going to have a distinct conversation from _".../user/**alice**/interact"_

      *Ensure `{userID}` is consistent every time the same user calls these endpoints.*

      By default, requests will target the dev version of your project. To specify a version, such as the live version, provide a `{versionID}` header.

      ### versionID
      `{versionID}` is in the URL on your project: `https://creator.voiceflow.com/project/{versionID}/canvas/...`

      ### Nomenclature
      - `state` is the user metadata - what block they are currently on, what flow they are on, their variables
      - `action` is an object representing a user's action or event
      - `trace` is an array of actions to take based on the request that the user made
  - name: Stateless API (deprecated)
    description: |
      The dialog management **stateless** API is very similar to the **state** API - with one difference:

      Instead of passing `{userID}` in the path parameters to retrieve the state, the entire state is passed in each request and response.

      The same request will *always* produce the same response.

      The API works by passing `state` back and forth, Voiceflow will never store user session data in the process.

      ### Nomenclature
      - `state` is the user metadata - what block they are currently on, what flow they are on, their variables
      - `action` is an object representing a user's action or event
      - `trace` is an array of actions to take based on the request that the user made
  - name: Custom Actions
    description: |
      Take advantage of the **Custom Action step** to allow you Voiceflow project to perform any kind of integration action.

      Examples can include triggering navigation your website or app, processing a credit card payment,
      opening the windows on a car, handing off to a human on a phone call, or anything else your app can support.

      Let's take a look at an example Custom Action step where we want to use a third party integration like *Stripe* for actually charging a credit card:
      ![Credit Card Custom Action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5643574/115419275-333b7d80-a1c8-11eb-9a70-30398f4c9358.png)

      In your request body call, you can specific which Custom Actions to **stop** on in the `config.stopTypes` field:
      ```
      {
        "action": { "type": "text", "payload": "hello!" } // any request type here,
        "config": {
          "stopTypes": ["Pay Credit Card"]
        }
      }
      ```
      This will inform the dialog manager to stop on any `Pay Credit Card` Custom Action, ensuring that the last trace is always the Custom Action.
      By default, Custom Action steps will always go out the default port, but still leave a trace.

      Here's what the Custom Action `trace` for the "Pay Credit Card" block above might look like:
      ```
      [
        ...other_traces,
        {
          "type": "Pay Credit Card",
          "payload": "{ 'amount': 25 }",
          "defaultPath": 0,
          "paths": [
            { "event": { "type": "success" } },
            { "event": { "type": "denied" } },
            { "event": { "type": "pending" } }
          ]
        }
      ]
      ```
      Now whenever we come across a `Pay Credit Card` trace, we can actually trigger a side effect such as the Stripe API and perform the action.
      Depending on the result of that, we can now select which path we want to go down. In the subsequent request body, you simply have to do this:

      ```
      {
        "action": { "type": "success" }
      }
      ```

      Where the `type` of the request is the same as the name of the path you've labelled in Voiceflow.
      If the next request is an invalid path, your project will simply behave as if there were no lines coming out of the Custom Action step.

      In summary, here's what's happening:
      1. We send a request saying to stop on our Custom Action
      2. We get a response which stopped on it
      3. In the next request we specify which path to go down
  - name: Custom NLP/NLU
    description: |
      Instead of using the default NLP service (Microsoft LUIS) provided by Voiceflow, it's easy to use a preferred custom NLP service.
      When making an API request, instead of using a `TextRequest` where the raw string of the user input is provided, use an
      `IntentRequest` and the default Voiceflow NLP is skipped.

      **Example Text Request:**
      ```
      {
        "action": {
          "type": "text", "payload": "can I get a pepperoni pizza?"
        }
      }
      ```

      **NLP Resolved Intent Request:**
      ```
      {
        "action": {
          "type": "intent",
          "payload": {
            "query": "can I get a pepperoni pizza?", // (optional) original raw string of user input
            "intent": {
              "name": "order_pizza_intent" // name of the intent, as specified on Voiceflow
            },
            "entities": [ // array of matched entities, can be empty
              {
                "name": "pizza_type", // name of entity
                "value": "pepperoni" // value of entity
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      So long as the intent generated by the custom NLP service is passed in as the `IntentRequest` format,
      Voiceflow will be able to generate the appropriate response.

      To export the model to use with your NLP service, go to the interaction model modal (<kbd>M</kbd>), and select the export option.

      <img width="540" alt="NLP Export" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5643574/123353543-9625f980-d516-11eb-8aee-8e29d1b32d19.png">

      Pick your NLP service of choice.

      <img width="540" alt="Interaction Model" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5643574/123353537-945c3600-d516-11eb-83e5-41bec0bb05d8.png">

      If your current NLP service is not supported you can consider creating a translation layer for the generalized model in the `.vf`, or contact Voiceflow.

      **Entity/Slot filling** - if the intent on Voiceflow has required entities (i.e `{pizza_size}` for `order_pizza_intent`)
      and it is not filled in the initial request, the entity will be prompted for and you can send a subsequent request with the same intent
      and the `entities` and Voiceflow will be able to automatically merge the initial entities with the new entities.

      For example, on the Voiceflow project for the `order_pizza_intent`, both `{pizza_type}` and `{pizza_size}` are required.
      1. the user says "can I get a pepperoni pizza?",
      2. this gets resolved through the NLP service and sent to Voiceflow as `order_pizza_intent` with entity `{pizza_type}` equal to `pepperoni`
      3. the response will ask "what size pizza do you want?".
      4. The user says "small"
      5. the next request is `order_pizza_intent` with entity `{pizza_size}` equal to `small`
      6. Voiceflow continues the conversation knowing the the user wants a small pepperoni pizza.

      *Note: on Step 5 any intent can be sent and resolved, it just needs to be the same intent to continue the entity filling*
  - name: No Reply Response
    description: |
      When the user gives no response at all - remaining silent or away from keyboard, we can use no reply feature.
      Under any "User Input" type step, there is an option to "Add No Reply Response", and also designate a timeout period.

      ![Screen Shot 2021-12-02 at 11 29 26 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5643574/144462791-b8e0f8bf-626e-453d-9dfb-78b0006ceaed.png)

      To handle interactions within the Dialog Manager API, we can reference the `no-reply` trace:
      ```
      trace: [
        ...otherTraces,
        {
          type: "no-reply",
          payload: {
            timeout: 5
          }
        }
      ]
      ```
      The responsibility of handling this is on your client calling the API.
      This would require a timer function of some kind that detects if the user has not responded within the `timeout` number of seconds.
      In which case, the next `request` is simply `null` to denote that the user has no replied, and the API will handle the following logic:
      ```
      {
        action: {
          type: "no-reply" //  BaseRequest.RequestType.NO_REPLY
        },
        // state, config, and other metadata here
      }
      ```

      description: >-
        Sends a request to advance the conversation session with your Voiceflow project.


        ### Requests

        There are different types of requests that can be sent. 

        1. **Launch request** - Starts the conversation session

        2. **Text request** - Wraps your user's response to your chatbot and is used to advance the conversation.

        3. **Intent request** - Wraps your user's response as an intent and is used to advance the conversation.


        For example, to start the conversation, your HTTP request body should look like:

        ```json

        {
          "type": "launch"
        }

        ```


        To pass in your user's response, your HTTP request body should look like:

        ```json

        {
          "action": {
            "type": "text",
            "payload": "I want a large pepperoni pizza"
          }
        }

        ```


        See the **Request Samples** on the right panel for more examples of valid request bodies.


        ### Response Traces

        After processing your request, the State API will then respond with an array of "traces" which are pieces of the overall response from the project:

        ```json

        [{
          "type": "speak",
          "payload": {
            "type": "message",
            "message": "would you like fries with that?"
          }
        }, {
          "type": "visual",
          "payload": {
            "image": "https://voiceflow.com/pizza.png"
          }
        }]

        ```

        In the example above, the Voiceflow project responded by saying "would you like
        fries with that?" and an image of a pizza. You can then display the chatbot's
        response and the image in your app. 


        There are many types of response traces. The most common ones include:

        1. `speak` - Contains a textual response from the Voiceflow project

        2. `visual` - Contains an image given as a response

        3. `choice` - Lists a fixed set of responses that the project expects the user to give.


        Each trace is produced by a particular block on your Voiceflow project. 


        ### Conversation sessions

        Multiple conversation sessions to your Voiceflow project can be running simultaneously.
        Each session is identified by the `userID` that you specify. 
        

        For example, customer A should communicate with `/state/user/customerA/interact` whereas 
        customer B should communicate with `/state/user/customerB/interact`. 
        
        
        You can choose what format the `userID` can take on.


        ### Runtime Logs


        The `logs` query parameter can be used to enable [debug logging](https://developer.voiceflow.com/reference/logs-reference), which includes `log` traces in the response.


        ### Legacy responses

        For legacy compatibility, you set the `verbose` query parameter to `true` to get a response 
        similar to our legacy Stateless API.
        

        ```json

        // <- simplified verbose response body
        {
          "state": {
            "stack": [{
              "programID": "home flow",

          "trace": [{
            "type": "speak",

              "message": "would you like fries with that?"
            }
          }, {
            "type": "visual",
            "payload": {
              "image": "https://voiceflow.com/pizza.png"

        The stateless API receives a request with `action` + `state`, and responds with a new `state` + `trace`. Here's what it looks like from the Voiceflow creator app prototype tool:

        1. User says/types something, take user's text request and current `state` and sends it via webhook to the Dialog Management API.
        2. Dialog Management goes through each block/flow and updates the user `state`.
        3. Generate a `trace` and new `state` of the user, send back response.
        4. Client interprets API response, and saves the new `state` to use with the next response.

        Repeat all steps each time a user speaks/types to the prototype tool, to perform a conversation.

        Let's take a look at this interaction: the blue user text is the request.
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5643574/105523483-6c894d80-5cac-11eb-900c-076ed15c1486.png" />

        The simplified example stateless **request**

        ```
        {
          "action": {
            "type": "text",
            "payload": "What is the balance in my chequing account"
          },
          "state": {
            "stack": [{
              "programID": "home flow",
              "nodeID": "prompt node"
            }],
            "storage": {},
            "variables": {
              "chequing_balance": null
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        The simplified example **response**

        ```
        {
          "state": {
            "stack": [{
              "programID": "home flow",
              "nodeID": "yes no choice node"
            }],
            "storage": {},
            "variables": {
              "balance": 0
            }
          },
          "trace": [{
            "type": "speak",
            "payload": {
              "type": "message",
              "message": "the balance in your chequing account is 0 dollars, is that all?"
            },
          }, {
            "type": "choice",
            "payload": {
              "choices": [{"name": "yes"}, {"name": "no"}]
            }
          }],
        }
        ```

        Notice that the `type: text` request got processed by the NLP handler to become an `type: intent` request.
        The `state` is updated, and a `trace` is generated in the API response.

        To move the conversation forward, you can create an action object and pass it in the response body to `/interact` along with the state and optionally a `config` object.
        This will return an updated `state`, an updated `action` (not shown in examples), and the trace array containing the traces to display.

        if `state` is undefined/empty, it will automatically use the **default state** (starting from the first block).

        The `logs` query parameter can be used to enable [debug logging](https://developer.voiceflow.com/reference/logs-reference), which includes `log` traces in the response.

      summary: Default state
      description: >-
        Returns the initial execution state of the conversation. This is the state of the Voiceflow diagram when
        the conversation has not started.

        You should pass initial execution state into the `state` field in the request body of a Stateless API interact request. 

        The initial execution state has all variables uninitialized. You may set these variables if you wish to
        direct the behaviour of your diagram programmatically before starting the conversation

        The intended logic for starting a conversation is as follows:

        1. Call this endpoint to obtain the initial execution state, `defaultState`
        2. Override the `defaultState.variables` property (optional)
        3. Set `defaultState` in the `state` field in a Stateless API interact request
        4. Invoke Stateless API interact to launch the conversation

        If you performed step 2., then these steps will launch the conversation with your custom variable values. If your Voiceflow
        diagram reads these variables, they can perform complex logic based on the value you pass in.
