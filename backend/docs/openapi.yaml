  title: Voiceflow Dialog Management API
  description: |
    # Overview
    The Dialog Management API is an HTTP API served by Voiceflow's dialog management server.
    It allows your Voiceflow project to be easily integrated into any interface: chatbot, voice assistant, IVR, web chat, and more - without the hassle of implementing the conversational flow using code.

    By sending a request of what a user wants to do, you can use your Voiceflow project to generate the response.

    # Quick Start
    For developers eager to get started without worrying about the details, here are a few quick steps to make your first call with the API.
    1. **Create a project**. You need to first build a conversational project on *[Voiceflow Creator](https://creator.voiceflow.com)*.
    2. **Create API Key**. If you are an admin of a Voiceflow workspace, create and manage API Keys under *Workspace Settings / Developers*.
    3. **Get Version ID**. On your project, it is in the URL: `https://creator.voiceflow.com/project/{versionID}/canvas/...`
    4. **Make a test call**. Use the examples below to make an API call. Make subsequent calls to the same endpoint, 
      changing the `payload` to reflect what the user might say. See how the response trace changes based on where in the project the user is.<br/>
      *Make sure to replace the `{apiKey}` and `{versionID}` with what you've gathered on steps 2 and 3*.
    5. **Implement your application**. Get familiar with the API by reading the rest of this documentation, and power the next conversation with your Voiceflow project!

    The **state** API is the *easier implementation* compared to the **stateless** API. But they both achieve the same function.

    # Endpoint
    The standard URL base for all Dialog Management API calls - this will be different if you are self-hosting or on a private cloud.
    ```
    https://general-runtime.voiceflow.com
    ```

      Voiceflow managed user state - **interact** is the only essential endpoint

      All endpoints take in two parameters in the URL: `{versionID}` and `{userID}`.

      ### versionID
      `{versionID}` is in the URL on your project: `https://creator.voiceflow.com/project/{versionID}/canvas/...`

      ### userID
      `{userID}` will need be generated yourself - it should be something unique that easily references the person on the session - such as an username, email, deviceID, or phone number.
      (*e.g.* `user54646`, `user@gmail.com`, `1-647-424-4242`, etc.).<br/> If you're not sure what to call it just for testing purposes, you can just pick a random `{userID}` like *steve*.

      For example <i>".../user/<b>steve</b>/interact"</i> is going to have a distinct conversation from <i>".../user/<b>alice</b>/interact"</i><br/>
      *Ensure `{userID}` is consistent every time the same user calls these endpoints.*

      ### Nomenclature
      - `state` is the user metadata - what block they are currently on, what flow they are on, their variables
      - `request` is an object representing a user's action or event
      - `trace` is an list of things for whatever client is calling the API to show

    description: |
      The dialog management **stateless** API is very similar to the **state** API - with one difference:<br/>
      the `state` that is saved and managed by Voiceflow is passed in the request and response instead. This means there is no longer any need for the `{userID}` in the path parameters - the token used to retrieve the state.

      The same request will *always* produce the same response

      The API works by passing `state` back and forth, with Voiceflow never storing user session data in the process.

      ### Nomenclature
      - `state` is the user metadata - what block they are currently on, what flow they are on, their variables
      - `request` is an object representing a user's action or event
      - `trace` is an list of things for whatever client is calling the API to show

        Resolve a conversation turn.
        Every time a request is sent you will get a unique response based on where the user is currently on in the Voiceflow project.

        Send out a request with a `type` and `payload`, and get back a response with a `trace` array to act on.

        ```
        // -> request body, send user intention or event
        {
          "request": {
            "type": "text",
            "payload": "can I order a large pepperoni pizza"
          }
        }
        // <- response body, an array of "traces"
        {
          "trace": [{
            "type": "speak",
            "payload": {
              "type": "message",
              "message": "would you like fries with that?"
            }
          }, {
            "type": "visual",
            "payload": {
              "image": "https://voiceflow.com/pizza.png"
            }
          }]
        }
        ```
        Common request types are `launch`, `text`, `intent` - reference the **Request Samples** on the right panel for examples.

        Use a `launch` request to reset the user and start from the first block in your Voiceflow project.

        Common response traces include `speak`, `visual`, `choice`, with custom types available - reference **Responses Samples** on the right panel for examples.
        Each trace gets produced by a particular block on your Voiceflow project.

        The stateless API receives a request with `request` + `state`, and responds with a new `state` + `trace`. Here's what it looks like from the Voiceflow creator app prototype tool:

        1. User says/types something, take user's text request and current `state` and sends it via webhook to the Dialog Management API.
        2. Dialog Management goes through each block/flow and updates the user `state`.
        3. Generate a `trace` and new `state` of the user, send back response.
        4. Client interprets API response, and saves the new `state` to use with the next response.

        Repeat all steps each time a user speaks/types to the prototype tool, to perform a conversation.

        Let's take a look at this interaction: the blue user text is the request.

        The simplified example stateless **request**

        ```
        {
          "request": {
            "type": "text",
            "payload": "What is the balance in my chequing account"
          },
          "state": {
            "stack": [{
              "programID": "home flow",
              "nodeID": "prompt node"
            }],
            "storage": {},
            "variables": {
              "chequing_balance": null
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        The simplified example **response**

        ```
        {
          "state": {
            "stack": [{
              "programID": "home flow",
              "nodeID": "yes no choice node"
            }],
            "storage": {},
            "variables": {
              "balance": 0
            }
          },
          "trace": [{
            "type": "speak",
            "payload": {
              "type": "message",
              "message": "the balance in your chequing account is 0 dollars, is that all?"
            },
          }, {
            "type": "choice",
            "payload": {
              "choices": [{"name": "yes"}, {"name": "no"}]
            }
          }],
        }
        ```

        Notice that the `type: text` request got processed by the NLP handler to become an `type: intent` request.
        The `state` is updated, and a `trace` is generated in the API response.

        To move the conversation forward, you can create a request object and pass it in the response body to `/interact/{versionID}` along with the state and optionally a `config` object. 
        This will return an updated `state`, an updated `request` (not shown in examples), and the trace array containing the traces to display.

        if `state` is undefined/empty, it will automatically use the **default state** (starting from the first block).
