## [BUTTONS](https://github.com/voiceflow/general-runtime/tree/master/lib/services/buttons/index.ts#L14)

The Buttons handler adds possible choices in each trace frame for the user to choose from as a response to a question.
The terminology comes from [suggestion chips in google actions](https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/df-asdk/rich-responses#suggestion_chips)
